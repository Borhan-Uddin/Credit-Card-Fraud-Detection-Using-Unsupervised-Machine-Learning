# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning

To detect fraudental transaction i used Outiler/Anomoly detection algorithms such as Local Outlier factor and isolation Forest algorithm.
Dataset can be download from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jacklizhi/creditcard) . In our dataset most of the transaction are lebeled as non-fraudental transcation , so in the dataset the oultliers are fraudental transction. Since the data has 2848037 data, to reduce computitional complexity and run time i use only 10% of original data. So the accuracy was not up to the mark.
